They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to do the job properly.
