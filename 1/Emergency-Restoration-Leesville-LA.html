In addition to being harmful, black mold can also stain surface areas it grows on, which can make it harder to successfully remove. Frequently, surface areas with black mold might need extra lightening or replacement to handle the spots. Sometimes, an encapsulating agent might be required to cover the stain and any remaining spores.</p>
