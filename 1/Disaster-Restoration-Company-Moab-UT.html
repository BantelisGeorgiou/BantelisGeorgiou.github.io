<p>The area that is being dealt with is sealed, as mold spores can quickly travel when they are interrupted. Air purification systems are usually utilized in conjunction with the sealing of the area to eliminate as lots of air-borne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the location includes making use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, as well as negative atmospheric pressure, which avoids the circulation of air in between the contaminated area and the locations around it.
