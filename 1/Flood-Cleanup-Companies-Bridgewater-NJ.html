<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Water damage, water intrusion, constructing envelope problems, and building and construction problems are a very severe matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing numerous problems due to dripping doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living facilities, houses, condos, townhomes, hotels, industrial buildings are specifically vulnerable to these problems as typically the builder subcontracts the exterior envelope work and wall assembly procedure, for that reason resulting in corners and expenses being cut.</p>
<p>Because common structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is usually associated with water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
