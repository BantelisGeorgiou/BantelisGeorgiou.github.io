<p>Any building that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at danger of mold growth. There is a fantastic video listed below that I motivate you to watch. We came across it while helping a reader with a RV water damage repair. Not just does it do a fantastic job of showing you the damage that water can do to a RV, the developer also shows how to repair the damage action by action.
