<h3>Local Fire Damage Restoration in Rohnert Park</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold professionals usually suggest is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the option on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush until the mold disappears. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. However, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such products absorb water easily.
