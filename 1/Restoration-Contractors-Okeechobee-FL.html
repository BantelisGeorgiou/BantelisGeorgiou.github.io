<p>To get moisture out of the iPhone's interior, you need a desiccant. Many individuals swear by uncooked rice, advising owners to put their moist iPad or iPhone in a huge bowl of the things (cover it completely) and leave it there for 2 days or so. A: Mold is a microscopic fungi that is part of the natural surroundings and essential for our environment. While it is needed in the outside world, too much mold inside a structure can be hazardous and unsanitary. Mold produces spores as part of its lifecycle, and these spores drift through the air both inside and outside.<p>
