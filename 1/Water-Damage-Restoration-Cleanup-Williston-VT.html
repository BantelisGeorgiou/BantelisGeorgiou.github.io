<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have been shown ineffective against getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Daily moisture readings need to be consisted of in the drying record to include a/c, equipment, and air systems. Wetness material levels for damp structural products must be recorded in a moisture content spreadsheet to show the development of drying These recorded wetness material readings will reveal that the structure is back to an appropriate variety of pre-loss condition. It is very important to understand that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will demonstrate if enough dehumidification is being used or if modifications are needed.</p>

Water intrusion where wet, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), fabrics) represent l ~ 5% to ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the area; and where products described as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floorings, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually taken in minimal moisture.</p>
