<p>Smoke damage is a typical adverse effects of fire damage, but it can happen by itself if a fire is contained. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier produces the most affordable humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers absorb wetness through chemical attraction rather of condensation to remove water from the air. A desiccant is a material that brings in and holds moisture.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may be present in products that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
