<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or business is among the most terrible things that can take place to a person or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being fully replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard may need fixing, if there is minor damage. However, if the damage is significant then the whole floor may need replacing and often even the subfloor as well. The kind of wood floor covering you may have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to happen. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a wider range of choices to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to eliminate water damage on the surface area. This type of floor covering can likewise have replacements for specific slabs. The very best way to take care of a water damaged location on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
