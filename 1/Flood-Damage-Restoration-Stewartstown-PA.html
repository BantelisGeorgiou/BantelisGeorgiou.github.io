<p>Mold can cause major health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually facilitates mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface area and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>The most essential aspect of fixing drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew occur most frequently. Despite the place or degree of the damage, we encourage using dehumidifiers, industrial fans, or similar makers that can move a large volume of air for maximum ventilation. Standard home fans are not efficient in moving a sufficient amount of air needed to dry a room sufficiently.</p>

<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature always attempts to reach equilibrium. Computing the humidity is necessary in drying due to the fact that when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The humidity constantly occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature level the air needs to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to attain an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas kind. Water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid kind if the air were to be cooled even more. The higher the dew point rises, the greater the quantity of moisture in the air.</p>
<p>Since big pieces of drywall require to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists, damaged areas bigger than 12 square inches may require a total replacement panel installed. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out. For instance, if the area where you removed the damaged drywall exposes studs or joists where it will be possible to protect a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you may have to change the entire drywall panel.</p>
