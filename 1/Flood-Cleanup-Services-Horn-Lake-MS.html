<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Horn Lake</h3>
<p>Regulated Hazardous Products & Mold - If a controlled or dangerous material becomes part of a water damage restoration task, then a specialized specialist may be needed to assist in damage assessment, and government guidelines apply.

<p>We called them out to assess water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They fasted to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were really pleased that we didn't need to lift a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much carried out in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to get the job done appropriately. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
