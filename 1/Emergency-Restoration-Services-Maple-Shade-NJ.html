<p>Depending on the amount of water present and the duration of saturation, you may have the ability to repair the water damage. Greatly saturated drywall will sag or fall apart to the touch and should be completely changed. You may be able to remove a small part of the wall and spot it if the drywall is still safely attached to studs and the water damaged location is small. Significant storms and flooding occasions can overwhelm numerous restoration companies. On the other hand, SERVPRO of N. Okaloosa, Walton, Holmes & Washington Counties can access resources from 1,700 Franchises across the state and country and even use Disaster Recovery Groups for significant storms and catastrophes.<p>

<p>9. Get rid of the home furnishings and floor covering. Clean your furniture and let dry thoroughly. Flooring is challenging to save, specifically when flooded with contaminated water like river water or drain water. If you were flooded with clean water and it's bone dry within 24 hours, you might be able to save your floor covering. If not, rip it up. To prevent mold in the restroom, make sure to open windows if you have them to improve ventilation and run the fan when showering, cleaning or shaving. Clean water off tough surfaces, like shower walls and sinks, and repair plumbing leaks as soon as possible. Scrub mold from surface areas as soon as it appears, then be sure to dry the location to prevent it from spreading.<p>
