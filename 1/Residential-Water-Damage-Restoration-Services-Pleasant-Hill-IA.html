We were really happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job properly.
