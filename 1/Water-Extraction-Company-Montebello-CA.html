<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was basic: It was a best storm"-- a mix that lawyers now declare originated from pressure to build quicker, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure products, and little federal government and builder oversight. Add to that an environment like Pennsylvania's, where the average annual rains is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much higher.</p>
