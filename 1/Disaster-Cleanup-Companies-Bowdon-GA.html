<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or service is one of the most terrible things that can occur to a person or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired instead of being completely replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be saved and an isolated floorboard may require fixing, if there is minor damage. Nevertheless, if the damage is major then the whole floor might require replacing and often even the subfloor also. The kind of wood flooring you might have identifies and limits the type of repair work that require to take place. Strong hardwood floor covering enables a larger range of alternatives to fix the problem. With solid hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This type of floor covering can likewise have replacements for individual planks. The very best way to look after a water damaged location on your wood floor is to change the affected boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
<p>An insurance policy might or might not cover the expenses related to water damage and the process of water damage restoration.
