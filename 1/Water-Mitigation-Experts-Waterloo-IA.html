<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely damaging. Jake and his guys were incredible in helping us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to your home and began drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the method and also were really handy in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
<p>Even when you include a little indoor fire, smoke damage can occur. That's because fire is a visible combustion of light and heat, and many people know how to contain a fire. Therefore, people will work to contain a fire without prioritizing smoke damage avoidance. Smoke is a little more difficult to see than the fire itself and appears less threatening. Also, since it's in the air, it's almost difficult to include. Even after a fire is dispatched, smoke in the air can trigger damage. Smoke damage restoration services are frequently required to restore damage left behind from small indoor fires.</p>
