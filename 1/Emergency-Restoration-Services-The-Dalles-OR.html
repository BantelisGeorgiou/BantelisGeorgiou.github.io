The best way to prevent mold growth is to get rid of water leaks or wetness in your house. See our article, How Do I Avoid Mold Development?" for mold prevention tips.</p>
<p>To keep indoor surface areas as dry as possible, try to maintain the home's relative humidity between 20-40 percent in the Winter season and less than 60 percent the rest of the year. You can acquire devices to measure relative humidity at some home supply shops. Ventilation, air flow near cold surface areas, dehumidification, and efforts to decrease the production of wetness in the home are all really essential in controlling high humidity that often triggers mold growth in our environment.</p>
