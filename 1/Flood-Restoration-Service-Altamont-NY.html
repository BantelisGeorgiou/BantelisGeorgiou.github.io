<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
