<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of home damage that a family or company can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals right away begin to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then quit working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with an extremely costly paperweight.</p>
