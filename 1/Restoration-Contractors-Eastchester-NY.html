<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration methods will involve browsing a large area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
