While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration approaches will include browsing a broad area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
