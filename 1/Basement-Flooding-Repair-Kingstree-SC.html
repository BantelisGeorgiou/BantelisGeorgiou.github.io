<p>Likewise, considering that bleach is mainly water, on permeable surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly taken in by the material. So, while you might have wiped off or blemished the surface mold to the point that you can't see it, you've in fact provided plenty of water to grow back and possibly spread the mold beneath the surface. If there is a great deal of mold development, seek advice from the U.S. Epa's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ".  versions of these and other assistance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the moldy material is not easily cleanable, such as drywall, carpet cushioning and insulation, then removal and replacement may be essential.<p>
