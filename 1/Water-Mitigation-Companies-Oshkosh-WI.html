<p>Any structure that has suffered from water damage or issues with excess moisture is at threat of mold growth. Use a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore security, and cover arms, hands and legs to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of visible mold. If the musty area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will reduce the incidence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, use business black mold removal items, which can be found in many hardware or home repair stores, to sanitize the musty areas, in addition to any nearby locations. If you use bleach, make certain it won't blemish the product or surface. Place all sponges, equipment and other products used in cleaning in a strong trash can, and if possible, remove the bag through a close-by exit as opposed to the primary home, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings must be included in the drying record to consist of air, heating and cooling, and equipment systems.

It is essential to know that air records alone will not show that a building is dry.
