Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have ended up being infected with molds.

<p>Floorings or walls, this is a sure indication of mold growth if there are dark spots on your ceiling. Moldy odors and mildew are typically indications that mold may be growing in your home. Respiratory and allergic reaction signs such as coughing, sneezing, trouble breathing and wheezing are a typical sign of mold development also. Also, high humidity levels such as condensation on glass and metal surfaces are an indication of mold.</p>
<p>There are 2 ways in which water enters a structure as a result of windstorm damage. Because of damage to roof elements or wall assemblies, the first involves falling or windblown rainwater that gets in. The 2nd includes horizontally traveling ground-surface water (Category 3) consisting of silt and soil pollutants that infiltrates into structures, generally through doors or around foundation walls. This ground-surface water (storm surge) may collect to a depth of a number of feet or numerous inches. When structures are partially immersed or remain considerably flooded for weeks, even more fancy treatments generally are needed</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we equip the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one system for each 2 to 3 spaces, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it travels through 3 filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the smell got rid of. This procedure goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of a number of days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>

They covered all the bases, and the repairs were dealt with to my satisfaction. I would use them again.<p>
