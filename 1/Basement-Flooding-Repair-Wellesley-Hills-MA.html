Water invasion where wet, permeable materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), fabrics) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the area; and where materials referred to as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually taken in very little wetness.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists prior to you make any adjustments.</p>

Today's restoration is more than drying wet carpets.</p>
