<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Experts have identified Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has affected sprawling rural homes, starter houses, and high-end Philadelphia townhouses alike. Residences constructed with products besides stucco had problems, too. Some houses with water damage were developed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by little, local companies. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually ended up being contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming air-borne. When the mold dies and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being air-borne.</p>
