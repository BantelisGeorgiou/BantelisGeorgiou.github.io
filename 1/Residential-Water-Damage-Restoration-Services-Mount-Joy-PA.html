Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak started, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and after that even assisted me closed down my main water valve.
