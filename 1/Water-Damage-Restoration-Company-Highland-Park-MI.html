<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his people were fantastic in helping us make it through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (typically twice a day) to keep track of and change the fans and dehumidifiers to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
