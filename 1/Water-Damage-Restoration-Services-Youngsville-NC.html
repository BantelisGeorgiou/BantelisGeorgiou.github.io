<p>Rust is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the gradual and slow deterioration of materials (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you integrate electrical power, water, metal and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more typically referred to as rust). There is no trusted schedule for this process to occur; a MacBook's internal components generally start corroding immediately after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can operate typically for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of an issue. How quick the corrosion process takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and how long the device stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
