<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly destructive. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying out our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained whatever they were doing along the method and also were very practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd advise them without hesitation.</p>
