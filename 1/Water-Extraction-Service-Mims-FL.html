<p>Flooding of a private sewage system can be a harmful circumstance for property owners, according to Pipes 2.0's experienced pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It may cause a back-up of sewage in the home, infected drinking water and absence of sanitation up until the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a personal sewage system can not function correctly (typical plumbing issues in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater rely on aerobic (with oxygen) regions to reduce the amounts of chemicals and living organisms (viruses, bacteria and protozoa). When the soil is saturated or flooded, those harmful products can enter the groundwater and your drinking water system.</p>
