They are extremely expert, polite, and above all else kind. We experienced a disaster shortly after buying our home. We called great restoration and the job was finished quickly and expertly.

<p>Since mold and mildew can be a severe health threat, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to remove as much as 18 inches of drywall. Nevertheless, FEMA advises that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product must be eliminated to a height of 4 feet. As drywall is available in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it much easier to change the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material must be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is higher.</p>

Some of the powerful storms making landfall here can typically carry the wind speed and fierceness to damage roofing systems and get rid of the siding.</p>
