<p>If you select to employ a specialist (or other professional provider) to do the cleanup, make sure the contractor has experience cleaning up mold. Examine recommendations and ask the professional to follow the recommendations in EPA guide Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings, the guidelines of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygenists (ACGIH), or other guidelines from professional or government companies.</p>
<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any modifications.</p>
<p>We will do our best to restore your contents to a pre-loss condition. Some items, when exposed to water for an amount of time, end up being completely damaged (i.e. they will never be the same). Other items might simply require to be sanitized and moved to high ground. Soft products like clothes, bedspreads, drapes can be sent out to a laundry service that we can schedule you. Another point is, there are different levels of contamination with water (see Categories of Water), which will factor into the equation of what can be saved and what should be replaced. We will deal with you throughout the loss, reserving items that we feel can not be successfully restored so you can make a list to develop into your insurance coverage adjuster. Your Adjuster will then determine a repayment for your items according to the terms of your policy.</p>
