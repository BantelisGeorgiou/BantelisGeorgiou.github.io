<p>Utilize a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, since it could inadvertently press liquid into the phone's more delicate parts. You may attempt vacuuming around the phone's fractures and openings to draw more water out if the phone was entirely immersed. As soon as the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Proper cleanup after mold removal is necessary to avoid recontamination. You must seal and instantly dispose of materials that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the shoes or boots you wore while cleaning, clean your clothing in hot water, and shower to wash away spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
