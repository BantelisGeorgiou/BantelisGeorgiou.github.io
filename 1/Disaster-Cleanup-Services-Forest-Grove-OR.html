<p>It's a stressful situation when water floods your floors, soaks into your walls, and damages your furnishings. Because a carpet cleaner can just do so much, you need a water damage cleanup group that does it all. Desiccants (silica gel, clay, calcium oxide) absorb moisture like a sponge. Place water-permeable packages of desiccants and damp products in airtight containers or in sealed areas, like closets. Some desiccants change color to suggest they are filled, which can take weeks or days, depending on just how much wetness products contain.<p>
