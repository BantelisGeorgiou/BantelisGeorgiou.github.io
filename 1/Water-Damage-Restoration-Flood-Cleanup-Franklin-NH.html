<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely damaging. Serious flooding and water damage can frequently occur in the blink of an eye. Violent weather condition, significant plumbing failures or roof leaks can trigger an unexpected surge of water to flood into a home or workplace.

<p>Getting it damp can turn into a major headache because the plaster drywall is soluble and porous in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the event where drywall does get wet and just begins to sag prior to drying, repairing it might simply require pressing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>

<p>Indoor mold growth can generally be seen or smelled. In many cases, if visible mold development exists, sampling is not needed. There are no health or exposure-based requirements that you can utilize to examine a mold sampling result. The Florida Department of Health does not advise mold testing or sampling to see if you have a mold problem, or to see what sort of mold may be growing.

<p>We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job effectively. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
