<p>Flood damage is a terrible possibility for homeowners who live along the seaside waterways of Long Island. Increasing tides and flash floods can wreak havoc on your home and the possessions inside, and the resulting water damage can produce a hazardous environment on your own and your household.

<p>Damaged locations bigger than 12 square inches might need a complete replacement panel set up due to the fact that big pieces of drywall need to be anchored to wall studs or ceiling joists. It depends on where the damage lies on the wall or ceiling and how you had to cut it out. For example, if the area where you eliminated the damaged drywall exposes joists or studs where it will be possible to secure a patch by screwing it into the stud or joist, you can do that. If not, you might have to replace the whole drywall panel.</p>
<h3>Smoke Clean Up Service in Fort Madison</h3>
<p>Remove plaster, paneling and wallboard to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by polluted floodwater, it can be a long-term health danger and need to be eliminated. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however use only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipelines, ductwork and wiring.<p>
