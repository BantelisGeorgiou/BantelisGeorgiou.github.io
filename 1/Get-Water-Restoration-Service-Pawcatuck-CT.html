Wear a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore defense, and cover arms, hands and legs to avoid contact with mold spores. Usage soap and a sponge to remove visible mold. If the moldy location is dry, gently spray with water, as this will minimize the occurrence of air-borne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, utilize commercial black mold removal products, which can be found in many hardware or home repair shops, to decontaminate the musty areas, in addition to any surrounding areas. Make sure it will not stain the product or surface area if you use bleach. Place all sponges, devices and other products utilized in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a nearby exit as opposed to the main house, to prevent distributing mold spores.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is an extreme, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach also emits harsh fumes and it even produces harmful gas when mixed with ammonia. There are much safer options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce harmful fumes or leave behind toxic residue. For these factors try to avoid utilizing bleach and if you must utilize it, just utilize it on non-porous surface areas.</p>
