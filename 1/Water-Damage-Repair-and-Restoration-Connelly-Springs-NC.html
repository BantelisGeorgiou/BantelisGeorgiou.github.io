<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show visible indications of moisture, dripping water, or indications of failing structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might sag or crumble under the weight of water that fills the naturally porous gypsum material.

Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
