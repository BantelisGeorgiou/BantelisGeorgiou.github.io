<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly devastating. Jake and his men were remarkable in assisting us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence.

<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or contaminated water. A fireplace can provide your living-room a sense of heat and convenience even when there's no fire, but a weathered and split chimney can typically let in rain during the cooler months which can seep through the walls.

<p>Current Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living-room and hauled away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot performed in one day!  Someone has come out every day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to finish the job properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
