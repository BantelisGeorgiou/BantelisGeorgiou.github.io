<h2>Effects of Water Damage in Bolivar</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal visible signs of wetness, dripping water, or indications of stopping working structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels may droop or collapse under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable gypsum product. Other times, you may see small indications like coffee-colored spots that might broaden with time.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise referred to as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become air-borne.</p>
