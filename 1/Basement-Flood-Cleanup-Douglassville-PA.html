<p>When you have actually found the angering development, whip up a mold-fighting solution. While lots of agents can battle mold (Borax, bleach, vinegar, and ammonia, among others), tea tree oil and grapefruit seed extract are typically considered the most reliable products to sanitize and deodorize the problem area. Furthermore, they're completely non-toxic. You can buy tea tree oil online and in health stores; just ensure that its from melaleuca alternifolia (an Australian tree) and that its active ingredients include 30 percent terpinen 4-ol and no more than 10 to 15 percent cineole. Grapefruit seed extract may be somewhat less reliable but much easier to find, also offered from these sorts of retailers.<p>
