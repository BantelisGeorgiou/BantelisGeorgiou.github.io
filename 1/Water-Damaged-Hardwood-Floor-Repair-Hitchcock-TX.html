<p>Rust is a process, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the steady and sluggish degeneration of materials (typically metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the rust occurs when you combine electrical energy, metal, oxygen and water, creating iron oxide (or what is more typically referred to as rust). There is no trusted schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components normally begin corroding immediately after the spill, however sometimes your Mac can work typically for days or weeks without showing any apparent indication of an issue. How fast the rust procedure takes depends upon a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can attend to the damage. Below are a couple of examples of deterioration brought on by a water spill.</p>
