<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is a harsh, corrosive chemical. Chlorine bleach likewise releases harsh fumes and it even produces harmful gas when blended with ammonia. There are safer alternatives such as borax or vinegar which do not produce hazardous fumes or leave behind poisonous residue. For these reasons try to prevent utilizing bleach and if you should use it, just use it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
