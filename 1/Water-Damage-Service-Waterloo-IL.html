<p>Due to the fact that typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
