<p>Remove wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. When damp, Wallboard acts like a sponge. If soaked by infected floodwater, it can be a permanent health danger and need to be removed. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney result" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipelines, ductwork and electrical wiring.<p>
