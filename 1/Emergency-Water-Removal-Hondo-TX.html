<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for every single 2 to 3 spaces, depending on the size of the room. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which implies that they get rid of at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the odor eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of a number of days, the air that can be found in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
