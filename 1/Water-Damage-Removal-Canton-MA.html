<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly damaging. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our drenched crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (frequently two times a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
<p>Eliminate the device from the water as quickly as possible, and get rid of the battery instantly. Removing the battery rapidly might make the difference to conserve your phone. Many phones have a white sign near the battery that will turn red or pink if water has actually damaged the device.

You can also attempt to dry it out with a vacuum cleaner, as long as you don't hold the vacuum too near the device.
