<h3>Fire Restoration Experts in Cornelius</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, plaster and wallboard to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when wet. It can be a long-term health hazard and should be gotten rid of if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the idea of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
