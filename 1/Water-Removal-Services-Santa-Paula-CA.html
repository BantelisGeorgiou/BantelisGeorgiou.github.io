<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or issues with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Disintegration to concrete and brick within a home is possible due to extended water exposure and requires masonry work to repair. Long-term staining on walls and floors is another possible result of water damage. Walls and floor covering may require replacement or refinishing depending on the extent of damage. Musty odors can linger in a home where leaks or flooding have happened and this could be a sign of excess mold and mildew growth.</p>
<p>As discussed, sometimes ceilings, walls, or floor covering need to be torn out, baseboards might be removed, or holes might be drilled into walls to ensure correct drying. The water restoration company might do these repairs themselves or they might farm out the work to professionals they use for this type of job. They may also suggest contractors for the house owner to call. Owners might also have the ability to use their own contractors if they so select. Having this conversation throughout the inspection phase of the process will let the property owner or business owner know what to expect when this phase is lastly reached.</p>

This procedure absorbs moisture without ice build-up and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can easily operate below freezing temperatures.</p>
