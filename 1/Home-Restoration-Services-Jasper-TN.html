<h3>Emergency Fire and Smoke Damage Cleanup in Jasper</h3>
<p>Protect Non-Damaged Locations- Once containment barriers are established we will begin getting rid of the wet dry wall and begin to dry inside the walls. If there is damaged carpet, we will pull the pad that is under the carpet, which allows the carpet to dry. We will also move furniture out of the wet areas to insure that all excess moisture inside a wall or under a floor is dried, so no mold issues develop later on.<p>
<p>The greatest component that can be eliminated is the moisture that mold needs to cultivate. There are over 100,000 types of species of mold, however the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore lands on a food source that is moist and warm, it begins to colonize and germinate within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots start to turn into the food source and mycotoxins or poisonous gasses are released as the fungi spreads. Mold in your home can be incredibly unsafe and lead to a variety of health problems. If the mold in your home is not eliminated properly it can continue to grow, making reliable mold remediation more costly and hard.<p>
