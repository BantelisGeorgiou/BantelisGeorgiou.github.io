<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying task back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments if you have questions on this.</p>

<p>To get rid of soot and smoke from walls, furniture and floors, use a mild soap or detergent or mix together 4 to 6 tbsp. tri-sodium phosphate and 1 cup family cleaner or chlorine bleach to every gallon of warm water. Use rubber gloves. Be sure to wash surfaces with clear warm water and dry thoroughly. Now, if you are a skilled tech specialist of sorts and know the ins and outs of a phone, and don't mind running the risk of voiding your guarantee, you can go ahead and take the whole phone apart too. It may aid with drying up every piece much faster. Simply beware, if you don't understand what you're doing this might cause more harm than great.<p>

<p>You wish to address bathroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates an ideal breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in mindful strong strokes so you aren't sprinkling the mold on the surrounding areas-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health concern. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
