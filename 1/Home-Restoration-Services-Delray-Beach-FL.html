When MacBook water damage has actually happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other parts.

If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this corrosion process. This causes the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight if this corrosion process is not stopped.</p>
