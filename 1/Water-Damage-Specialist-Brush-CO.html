<p>Given that it's difficult to eliminate mold in your home totally, it is essential to keep your air clear by routinely changing air filters. Consider utilizing High Performance Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are created to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger (mold is usually 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from circulating. You may also consider an air cleanser that will eliminate mold spores. If you reside in a particularly wet environment, find one with an antimicrobial filter to ensure that the filter itself stays devoid of mold.</p>

<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he discovered how much water bill I was paying since the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the area & discovered of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Really polite and easy-going individual.</p>
