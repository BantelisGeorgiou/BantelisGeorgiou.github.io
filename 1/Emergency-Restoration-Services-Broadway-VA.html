<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he discovered how much water costs I was paying since the leak began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my main water valve.
