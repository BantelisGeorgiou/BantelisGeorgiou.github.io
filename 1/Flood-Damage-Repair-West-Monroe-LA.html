The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to examine which drying equipment or approaches will be the most reliable. It is crucial to identify if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system.

The greater the number, the faster products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
