Flood damage restoration may be needed for a flood emergency that can occur at any time.

We have the water damage professionals and professional equipment needed for quickly saving your home. Even after mold remediation, in many cases, a noticeable difference in color remains between mold-affected locations and those unaffected by mold. In some cases dark or even black discolorations might still be visible. The location can be without mold (due to mold remediation) yet remain visibly stained. This is where mold cleaning comes in.<p>
<p>Mold requires nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can likewise obtain nutrients from some artificial items such as adhesives and paints. Mold needs moisture, although some mold species can acquire that moisture from damp air when the relative humidity is above 70 percent. Carefully pry baseboards far from walls so that you can inspect sheetrock at floor level. The porous product can rapidly absorb flood water, and you need to know the degree of possible damage.<p>
