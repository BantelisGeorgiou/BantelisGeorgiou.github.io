Ceiling drywall panels might sag or crumble under the weight of water that fills the naturally permeable plaster product. Other times, you might discover small signs like coffee-colored stains that might expand over time.</p>
<p>Another drawback of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's used on as it is a harsh, destructive chemical.
