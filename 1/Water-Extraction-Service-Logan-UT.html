<p>Rust is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the sluggish and steady wear and tear of products (normally metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the rust takes place when you integrate electrical power, water, metal and oxygen, developing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no reliable schedule for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal elements generally start wearing away right away after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can operate generally for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of a problem. How quick the corrosion procedure takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and the length of time the device remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all till you can deal with the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust caused by a water spill.</p>
