Hyphae or roots start to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or poisonous gasses are released as the fungis spreads. Mold in your home can be incredibly unsafe and cause a range of health issues. If the mold in your house is not gotten rid of appropriately it can continue to grow, making effective mold remediation more difficult and expensive.<p>
