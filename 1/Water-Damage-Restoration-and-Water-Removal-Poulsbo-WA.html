<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As discussed, fast air movement throughout wet surfaces of assemblies or materials is a critical element of efficiently and efficiently drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area vary from moving excess moisture within the materials or assemblies. Fast air motion across the surface of material becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface moisture paves the way to minimizing moisture content in low evaporation products. The consistent and falling rates of drying products require various requirements for altering conditions.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was easy: It was a perfect storm"-- a combination that attorneys now declare originated from pressure to build much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure materials, and little government and home builder oversight. Add to that a climate like Pennsylvania's, where the average annual rainfall is around 41 inches-- and the potential for water damage was that much greater.</p>
