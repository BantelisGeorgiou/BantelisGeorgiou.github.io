<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the water company told me if it's going at the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already full, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying since the leak started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He discovered & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve. Really respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
