<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Look for visible mold development (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leathery and have different colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold frequently appears as a staining or fuzzy growth on furniture or structure products (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper). Try to find indications of wetness or water damage (water leaks, standing water, water discolorations, condensation, etc.).</p>
