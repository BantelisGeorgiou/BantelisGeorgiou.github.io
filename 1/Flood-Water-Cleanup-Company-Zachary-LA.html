<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have been shown inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

Constantly make sure your tableware and serving dishes are dry before keeping them to keep mold from proliferating in cabinets. Scrub mold from surfaces as quickly as it appears, then make sure to dry the location to prevent it from spreading out.</p>
