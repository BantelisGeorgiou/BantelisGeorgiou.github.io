<p>Experiencing a disaster that needs fire damage cleanup in your home or business is among the most destructive things that can happen to an individual or a family. Depending on the damage the hardwood floor might be repaired rather than being completely replaced. Then the bulk of the floor can be conserved and an isolated floorboard may need repairing, if there is small damage. Nevertheless, if the damage is major then the whole floor might require changing and often even the subfloor as well. The kind of wood flooring you might have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to happen. Solid hardwood flooring enables a broader range of alternatives to fix the issue. With strong hardwood floors, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface. This kind of floor covering can also have replacements for individual slabs. The best method to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and after that refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying look.</p>
