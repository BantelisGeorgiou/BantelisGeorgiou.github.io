<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration in Alvarado</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repairs, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By decreasing the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This assists reinforce the strength of the wall and assists separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is finished.<p>
