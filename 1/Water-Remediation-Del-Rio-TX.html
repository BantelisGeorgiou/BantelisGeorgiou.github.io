Molds is available in various types; in reality, according to the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, there are most likely tens of countless kinds of molds, if not more. Molds play an essential role in breaking down plants, leaves and trees. While numerous molds are harmless, hazardous types in enclosed places can cause respiratory distress, manifesting itself in symptoms that consist of stuffy noses and wheezing.
