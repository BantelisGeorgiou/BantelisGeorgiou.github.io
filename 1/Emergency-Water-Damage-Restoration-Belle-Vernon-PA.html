Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
