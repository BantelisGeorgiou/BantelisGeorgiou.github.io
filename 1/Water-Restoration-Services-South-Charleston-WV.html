<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually impacted your possessions, we will deal with you and your insurance company to identify what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For products that can be brought back, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged personal belongings. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is act like a glue which penetrates into permeable surface area, preventing water from permeating back through. Basically, it makes the area solid again and secures the surface from future water damage. After you have actually applied the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
