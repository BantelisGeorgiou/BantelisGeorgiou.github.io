<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Black mold can be unsafe to your health, mainly causing breathing problems. However in extreme cases and for individuals with pre-existing health conditions, black mold can cause pneumonia. When you suspect a mold intrusion, you might want to purchase a mold testing set to see what type of mold spores you're dealing with, and hire a professional to assist with removal. However in the short-term, here are some natural home treatments (made with things you most likely currently have on-hand) that will help get rid of mold.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins exist, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and passes away up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become airborne.</p>
