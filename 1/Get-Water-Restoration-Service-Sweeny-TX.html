Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he found out how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Really respectful and easy-going individual.<p>
