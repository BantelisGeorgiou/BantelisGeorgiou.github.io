<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying devices or methods will be the most reliable. It is crucial to identify if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and reasonable energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple building products and how they respond to each one and provide the very best evaporation results. The higher the number, the much faster materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
