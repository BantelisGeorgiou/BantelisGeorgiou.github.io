Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he found out how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve.
