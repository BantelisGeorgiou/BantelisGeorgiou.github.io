<p>Due to the fact that typical structure materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
