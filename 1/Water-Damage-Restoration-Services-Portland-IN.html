<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air up until they land someplace. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is excellent and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores.

<p>Vapor pressure is directly related to humidity ratio (particular humidity or grains per pound-gpp and dew point). As heat is used to a product, energy is added. Raising the temperature level of a wet product increases the rate of evaporation, further releasing wetness from the product and changing the internal vapor pressure. The higher the difference in between ambient temperature and humidity temperature level, the greater the capacity for faster and more effective drying.</p>

Computing the dew point is essential in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surfaces. The humidity always occurs at 100% relative humidity (RH). The dew point is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at constant pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this moment the air can not hold more water in gas type. If the air were to be cooled a lot more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form. The greater the humidity rises, the higher the quantity of moisture in the air.</p>
