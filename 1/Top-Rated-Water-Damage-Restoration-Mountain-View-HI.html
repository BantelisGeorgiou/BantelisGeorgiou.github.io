<h3>From Fire Water Restoration to Mold Removal in Mountain View</h3>
<p>Many molds grow at normal indoor temperatures; few if any molds have the ability to grow below 40 F or above 100 F. Outside this range molds might remain dormant or non-active; they may start to grow again when the temperature is more favorable. Temperatures well above 100 F will eliminate mold and mold spores, however the exact temperature needed to eliminate specific types is not well established.<p>
<p>The biggest element that can be gotten rid of is the wetness that mold needs to cultivate. There are over 100,000 kinds of types of mold, however the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore arrive on a food source that is moist and warm, it begins to colonize and sprout within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots begin to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or dangerous gasses are released as the fungi spreads. Mold in your house can be very dangerous and result in a range of health issues. If the mold in your home is not removed appropriately it can continue to grow, making efficient mold remediation more hard and expensive.<p>
