<p>You want to attend to restroom flooding as rapidly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and develops a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the roadway to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to raise and agitate the dampened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing completely with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>When tiny mold spores take a trip through the air and settle, under the ideal conditions, mold or mildew can multiply rapidly, often going undiscovered, and become a problem inside your home. Mold can grow practically anywhere when wetness is present for a prolonged amount of time.
