<p>Protect Non-Damaged Locations- As soon as containment barriers are established we will begin getting rid of the damp dry wall and start to dry inside the walls. If there is damaged carpet, we will pull the pad that is under the carpet, which allows the carpet to dry.

Aim to accelerate the drying procedure by aerating the location. If possible and run a dehumidifier, open doors and windows. You can likewise use air movers to quickly dry the surface.<p>
