Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
