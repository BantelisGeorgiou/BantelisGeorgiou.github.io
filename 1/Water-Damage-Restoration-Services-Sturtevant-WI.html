<h3>Why You Should Hire Sturtevant Professionals for Your Fire Damage</h3>
<p>Mold might be growing in your home and you don't even know it, that's since mold likes dark, warm, damp places to live. Due to the fact that they are in consistent contact with wetness, your basement, kitchen area and restroom are at the most risk for mold and bacteria development. When the conditions are right, mold can grow within 24-48 hours. Leaving mold untreated can trigger breathing diseases as well as be a major factor for year-round allergic reactions. This is why it is so crucial to kill mold at first sight.<p>
<p>The last and most important part of how to eliminate mold is drying the surface area. Bear in mind that wetness is the main cause of mold build-up. These fungis enjoy the damp, moist environment. Considering that you will be cleaning mold with water, the surface area will be wet for a time period. Aim to accelerate the drying process by aerating the area. If possible and run a dehumidifier, open windows and doors. You can also utilize air movers to quickly dry the surface area.<p>
