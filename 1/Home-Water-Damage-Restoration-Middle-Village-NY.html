Standing water and bulk sewage must be drawn out with self-contained vacuum devices with appropriate waste holding tanks which should be dealt with effectively. Difficult surface areas that are affected should be cleaned up and sterilized. Soft structural products such as carpeting, carpet pads, plaster wallboard ought to be removed and appropriately gotten rid of.

The greater the humidity increases, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
