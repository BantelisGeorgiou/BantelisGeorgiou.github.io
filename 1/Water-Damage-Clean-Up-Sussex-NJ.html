<h3>Fire Damage Repair in Sussex</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repair work. By lowering the thickness here, it's easier to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is ended up, this helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
