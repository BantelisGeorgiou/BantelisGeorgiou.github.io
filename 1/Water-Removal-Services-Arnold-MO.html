<p>Daily moisture readings must be included in the drying record to include equipment, a/c, and air systems. Moisture content levels for damp structural materials need to be recorded in a wetness content spreadsheet to reveal the progress of drying These tape-recorded wetness content readings will show that the building is back to an appropriate variety of pre-loss condition. It is very important to know that air records alone will not prove that a building is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will demonstrate if enough dehumidification is being used or if adjustments are needed.</p>
<h3>Water Restoration Services in Arnold Missouri</h2>
<p>Mold in the basement can be persistent, provided the nature of basements - they tend to be a lot more damp than above-ground levels and typically have bad ventilation and little air circulation, a mix that can trigger mold to grow. And naturally, basements can be prone to flooding, due to severe weather or undiscovered leakages in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, when mold develops, concrete block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily dependent on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any modifications.</p>
