<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction between the oxygen that is present in the atmosphere and a source of flammable fuel. Once this combustible fuel - drywall, furnishings, or carpet - has been warmed to its special ignition temperature level, the fuel will catch fire and unstable gases will be launched in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause enduring damage and should be dealt with by experienced specialists, heat is the most noticeable, and destructive, product of this chain reaction.
