<p>If you have water damage, It is essential to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be obvious that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal visible indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of stopping working structural stability. Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally permeable gypsum material. Other times, you may see little signs like coffee-colored spots that might broaden in time.</p>
<p>Getting it wet can turn into a major headache because the gypsum drywall is porous and soluble in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply starts to droop prior to drying, repairing it may simply require pushing it back into place, securing it with some new screws, and then painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
