<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (likewise called Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or wet. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some strains of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends on what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other factors. When mycotoxins exist, they occur in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in products that have actually become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to become airborne.</p>
