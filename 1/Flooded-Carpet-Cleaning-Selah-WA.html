<p>Before you clean your home, you must use correct protection. Smoke, particles and soot can be hazardous to breathe in, so use a respirator if there is significant soot in the damaged location. Use long pants and sleeves to secure your skin. You must also use gloves and eye protection. Since you will be releasing soot as you clean, it is essential to set floor security and eliminate any furnishings or family objects that are not damaged. If the damaged location is small, you can probably get away with merely covering furnishings with plastic or sheets. But if you're cleaning a whole space, it's smart to eliminate those clean products and even seal other spaces that are undamaged. Be mindful of the shoes you're using so you don't track soot spots into other spaces.<p>
