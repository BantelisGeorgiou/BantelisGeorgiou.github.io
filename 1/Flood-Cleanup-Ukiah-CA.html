<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is actually made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread, damaging a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a large area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
