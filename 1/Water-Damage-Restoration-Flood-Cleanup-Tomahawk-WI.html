<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As mentioned, fast air motion across wet surface areas of materials or assemblies is a vital part of effectively and efficiently drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the materials or assemblies.

The consistent and falling rates of drying materials need different criteria for altering conditions.</p>
