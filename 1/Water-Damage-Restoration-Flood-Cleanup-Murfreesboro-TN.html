<h3>Basement Flooding Murfreesboro TN 37130</h3>
<p>Mold is growing due to damage by sewage or infected water. A fireplace can offer your living room a sense of warmth and convenience even when there's no fire, but a weathered and split chimney can typically let in rain during the colder months which can seep through the walls. In time, wetness from the water can cause the paint on the wall to bubble, peel and flake. Water damage can turn your cosy little living-room into a worn out and unloved space.<p>
<p>Eliminating one of the 3 requirements for mold decreases (or removes) new mold growth: moisture; food for the mold spores (for instance, dust or dander ); and heat since mold typically does not grow in cold environments.
