The best method to avoid mold growth is to remove water leakages or moisture in your home. See our post, How Do I Avoid Mold Development?" for mold avoidance suggestions.</p>
<p>Mold (American English) or mould (British English), also in some cases described as mildew, is a fungal development that develops on damp materials. Mold is a natural part of the environment and plays an important part in nature by breaking down dead raw material such as fallen leaves and dead trees; indoors, mold development ought to be avoided. Mold reproduce by means of tiny spores. The spores resemble seeds, but unnoticeable to the naked eye, that drift through the air and deposit on surface areas.
