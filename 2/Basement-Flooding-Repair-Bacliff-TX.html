<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, drifting through the air until they land someplace. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same method, so if the location the spores land is good and damp, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>

<p>Next usage the dry-cleaning sponge (chemical sponge) to wipe the soot and smoke stains. This phase is vital, as these sponges use special chemicals to lift discolorations from walls. Never use soot cleaner or water before you utilize a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread the soot and make it difficult to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly utilizing a clean surface area. When all sides are stained, trim the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces underneath. Or just grab a new sponge. Make certain you use a cleaning motion the entire time. You might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the spots.</p>
