<h3>Dealing With Fire Damage Properly in Oakland Gardens</h3>
<p>Get rid of paneling, plaster and wallboard to at least the flood level. When wet, Wallboard acts like a sponge. It can be a permanent health threat and need to be eliminated if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the pointer of the blade and keep an eye out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
