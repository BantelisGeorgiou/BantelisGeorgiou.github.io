As soon as the source of water is identified you will need to take steps to treat the problem and seal the leakage. Bales Restoration was prepared when we got the emergency water-damage call for this flooded office complex. One of the flexible lines from the HVAC system on the 4th floor drained pipes the system and stopped working.<p>
<p>After any type of water damage, the possibility of mold growth increases. Guaranteeing that the location was correctly dried and after that sanitized must minimize this probability.

Mold remediation is a multi-step procedure that begins after the area has been completely dried. Big fans and dehumidifiers may be needed to help dry the location before remediation can begin. In addition, if the source of the wetness or leakage has not been repaired, this must occur first.<p>
