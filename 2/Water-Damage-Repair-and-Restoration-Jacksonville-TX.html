<p>Air Cleaning: Instantly we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for every single 2 to 3 rooms, depending upon the size of the space. These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is sucked through the consumption where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which suggests that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
