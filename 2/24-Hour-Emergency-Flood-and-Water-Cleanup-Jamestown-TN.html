These systems have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are checked and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which means that they eliminate at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor removed. This procedure goes on for days.
