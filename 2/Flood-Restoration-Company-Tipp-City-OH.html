<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Tipp City</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repairs, keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By decreasing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is essential to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is typically attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is ended up.<p>
