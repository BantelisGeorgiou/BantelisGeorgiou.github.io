<p>The most important aspect of correcting drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew occur most regularly when damp drywall sits with inadequate ventilation. Regardless of the location or degree of the damage, we encourage using dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or similar devices that can move a large volume of air for maximum ventilation. Standard family fans are not capable of moving an appropriate quantity of air needed to dry a room effectively.</p>

<p>Recent Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our kitchen after we found our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they returned the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much done in one day!  Somebody has come out each day to check in and I feel confident in their understanding and abilities to do the job appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>When a grease fire started on the stove, a Wisconsin home in SE Wisconsin experienced a kitchen area fire. The owner used a fire extinguisher to put out the fire but after smoke and soot took a trip throughout your house of this two-story home it was impacted in various ways. Even the attic insulation had soot on it that needed it all to be eliminated. Water and sewage need to be extracted, and the affected locations expertly cleaned, aerated, dried and disinfected as quickly as possible to decrease germs, mold. and other hazardous microorganism development, which can cause additional damage to the residential or commercial property on top of water damage and produce prospective health dangers for your household or workers.<p>
