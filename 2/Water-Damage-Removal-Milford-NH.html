Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt how much water costs I was paying since the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the location of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve.
