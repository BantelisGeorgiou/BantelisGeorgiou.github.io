<h3>Local Fire Damage Restoration in Livingston</h3>
<p>When you are preparing big repairs, remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet. By minimizing the density here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under numerous coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it's important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is finished, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
