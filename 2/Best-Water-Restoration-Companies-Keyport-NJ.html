<h3>Importance of Hiring Fire Damage Cleanup Specialist in Keyport</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing big repair work. By minimizing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished look, it is necessary to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is ended up, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
