<p>Find out how to get rid of black mold securely and effectively. When you have water damage and aren't sure immediately from where the source of damage is coming from, burst or broken pipelines can be a significant headache. Sprinkler line pipe burst typically goes unnoticed until the water comes hurrying through basement window wells and walls causing considerable basement water damage. A pipeline burst in the attic can cause gallons of water raining down on the rooms inside your home.</p>
<p>Mix one part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water and in a spray bottle. If you really wish to prevent purchasing a spray bottle (although seriously, get the bottle!), you can also soak a towel in this option and wipe it directly over mold growth. Let the service sit for approximately 10 minutes, and after that scrub the location with a little brush or tooth brush. Wipe any remaining mold away with a towel and let the area dry.</p>
