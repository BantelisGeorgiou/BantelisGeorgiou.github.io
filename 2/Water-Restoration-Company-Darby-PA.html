<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the very same way, so if the place the spores land is moist and excellent, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a major headache since the gypsum drywall is soluble and permeable in water. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get damp and just starts to sag before drying, repairing it may just require pressing it back into location, securing it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
