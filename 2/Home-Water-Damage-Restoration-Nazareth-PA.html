<p>Smoke damage is a common adverse effects of fire damage, however it can occur on its own if a fire is included. Desiccant dehumidifiers - This type of dehumidifier produces the lowest humidity ratio. Desiccant dehumidifiers soak up wetness through chemical attraction instead of condensation to get rid of water from the air. A desiccant is a product that attracts and holds wetness. This material imitates a sponge drawing moisture from the air (sorption). When the wheel turns through warmed exhaust air, the wetness evaporates (desorption) and is brought outdoors. Then the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Since typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, typically condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
