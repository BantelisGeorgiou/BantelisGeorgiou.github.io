Water invasion where wet, porous materials (e.g., carpet, plaster board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), fabrics) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling area in the area; and where materials described as low evaporation materials (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually absorbed very little wetness.</p>
<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process includes checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air.
