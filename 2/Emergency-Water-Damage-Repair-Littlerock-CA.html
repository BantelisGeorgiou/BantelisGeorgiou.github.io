<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. As pointed out, fast air motion throughout damp surface areas of materials or assemblies is an important component of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or products. Fast air motion throughout the surface area of product becomes lesser relative to vapor pressure as the focus of eliminating surface area wetness paves the way to reducing moisture content in low evaporation materials. The consistent and falling rates of drying products require different requirements for altering conditions.</p>
