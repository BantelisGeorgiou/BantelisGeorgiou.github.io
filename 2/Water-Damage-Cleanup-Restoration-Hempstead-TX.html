Water intrusion where damp, porous materials (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry system (CMU), fabrics) represent more than ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the space; and where materials referred to as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have actually absorbed very little moisture.</p>

<p>If smoke and fire damage has actually affected your belongings, we will work with you and your insurance provider to determine what can be restored, and what will be an insurance replacement claim. For items that can be restored, we utilize ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged valuables. For this, we used Zinsser's Water Based Peel-Stop What this does is imitate a glue which permeates into permeable surface, avoiding water from permeating back through. Essentially, it makes the location strong again and safeguards the surface area from future water damage. After you have applied the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
