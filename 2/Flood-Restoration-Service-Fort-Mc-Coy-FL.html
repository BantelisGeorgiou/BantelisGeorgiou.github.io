Bleach can not penetrate into porous products and so it does not enter contact with mold growing underneath the surface of products such as wood and drywall.

<p>Material Removal: Some products will have to be removed prior to the start of the cleaning procedure. Frequently, walls, cabinets, and ceilings near the source of the fire are beyond saving. In these cases, our service technicians remove the materials and get rid of them.

When they returned the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.
