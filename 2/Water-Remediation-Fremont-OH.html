Attack is a concentrated formula that will disinfect hard, nonporous surface areas, and also sterilizes semi-porous and porous surface areas. Assault is particularly useful as an all-in-one product for dealing with wood structural members, carpets, and other permeable and nonporous surfaces as part of a total mold remediation task.</p>
<p>Because common structure products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or wetness direct exposure and may be triggered by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
