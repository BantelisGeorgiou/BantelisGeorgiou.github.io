<p>The area that is being dealt with is sealed, as mold spores can easily travel when they are disturbed. Air filtering systems are typically utilized in combination with the sealing of the area to remove as numerous airborne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the location involves the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative air pressure, which prevents the flow of air between the contaminated area and the areas around it.

Kitchen flare-ups, closed fireplace flues, and electrical fires can send smoke throughout your home, charring walls, covering whatever, and stinking up the place. The longer you let smoke and smells linger, the more they soak into walls, carpets, and furnishings. So get to work, however not without gloves, eye security, a facemask, and a respirator to keep smoke particles off your skin and out of your lungs.</p>
