<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he learnt how much water costs I was paying because the leak began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and then even helped me closed down my main water valve. Easy-going and very polite person.</p>
