<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living-room and transported away whatever else.  We were extremely happy that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they came back the next company day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got a lot carried out in one day!  Someone has come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job properly. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>However you might not have the ability to get insurance to pay for your mold remediation costs if the damage is a result of your neglect-- for instance, if you have actually had a sluggish leakage under your restroom sink for several years and have ignored the problem. They likely will not cover mold remediation costs if the insurer can figure out that the mold damage is an outcome of your carelessness.
