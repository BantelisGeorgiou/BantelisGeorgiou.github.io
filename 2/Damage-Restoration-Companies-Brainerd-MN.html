These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, over the course of several days, the air that is available in through the intake is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
