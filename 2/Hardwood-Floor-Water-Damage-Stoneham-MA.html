<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly harmful. Once InstaScope was developed, we engaged a team of scientists at the University of Colorado. Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally recognized professional on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was assigned to confirm and test the brand-new innovation. Needless to state, it passed with flying colors. Together, we had the ability to develop a new mold-assessment system for industrial customers that, unlike any other technique or gadget, can provide clinically accurate, area-by-area results-- and do so instantly. So when you consider all the risks of mold, InstaScope is a vital tool to help ensure the health of your home and the health of your household.</p>
<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being wet or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and may exist in materials that have actually become infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from ending up being airborne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to become air-borne.</p>
