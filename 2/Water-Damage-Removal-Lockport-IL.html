<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences.

<p>Because typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
