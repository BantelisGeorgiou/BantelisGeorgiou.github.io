<p>Form Removal. Structure products and individual belongings in your house can be affected. Considering that mold is a living organism and deeply ingrains itself into products to survive, it is best to deal with anything permeable. The safest and most efficient method to guarantee mold does not return is to get rid of afflicted material. Nonporous products can be cleaned up with antimicrobial cleaners and sealants may be used to make treated areas more resistant to water and mold.

<p>Once standing water is eliminated, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually taken in (this will momentarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. If you have concerns on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians prior to you make any changes.</p>
