<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally associated with water or wetness exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
