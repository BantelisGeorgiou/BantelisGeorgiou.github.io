<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be incredibly destructive. Our task isn't done till your residential or commercial property is fully restored, back to the method it was prior to the mishap. This consists of changing the flooring, drywall, baseboards, ceiling, and even repainting. One of our specializeds is restoring or replacing hardwood or engineered flooring. Our artisan will remove the damaged boards, saving what's possible and bring back the floor to its original lustre.</p>
<p>Class 4 - deeply held or bound water. Water intrusion that involves a considerable quantity of water absorption into low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, gym floors, or other complex, built up assemblies). Drying might need special approaches, longer drying times, or significant water vapor pressure differentials.</p>
