<p>Because typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can cause interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, typically condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
