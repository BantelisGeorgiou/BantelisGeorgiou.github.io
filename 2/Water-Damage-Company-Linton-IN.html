<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has absorbed (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) remove the wetness in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking process includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily based on temperature too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes.</p>
