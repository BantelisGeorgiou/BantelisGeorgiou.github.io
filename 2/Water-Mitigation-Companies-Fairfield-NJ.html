<p>Mold can trigger major health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. Experts have actually identified Pennsylvania the epicenter of an industrywide epidemic that has actually impacted stretching suburban homes, starter houses, and luxury Philadelphia townhouses alike. Properties constructed with materials other than stucco had problems, too. Some homes with water damage were developed by billion-dollar public companies. Others, by small, local firms. Some are 10 or twenty years old. Others are brand-new.</p>
