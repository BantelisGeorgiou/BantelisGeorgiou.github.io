<p>I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got an expense for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the current rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he discovered just how much water costs I was paying considering that the leakage began, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going individual.<p>
