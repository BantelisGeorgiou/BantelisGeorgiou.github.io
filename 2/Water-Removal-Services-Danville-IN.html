<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven ineffective versus getting rid of mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will only kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
