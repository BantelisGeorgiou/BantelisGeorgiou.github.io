This material imitates a sponge drawing wetness from the air (sorption). When the wheel turns through warmed exhaust air, the wetness evaporates (desorption) and is carried outside. Then the cycle repeats.</p>

Wood, paint, and porcelain materials are highly susceptible to unnoticeable smoke damage. Smoke damage, whether noticeable or undetectable, takes its toll on not only your valuables but you also.
