<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally associated with water or wetness direct exposure and might be triggered by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
