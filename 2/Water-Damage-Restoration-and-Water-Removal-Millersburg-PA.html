Rainbow came out to the house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action required to avoid additional damage burning the midnight oil into the night. They also finished the whole dry out which took several days and a great deal of effort. Always shown up on time and did what they assured and kept me notified of each step.

<p>The spores can easily spread in the air so it is best to utilize proper ventilation in the space while cleaning.

Since you will be releasing soot as you clean, it is necessary to put down floor security and get rid of any furniture or home objects that are not damaged.

But if you're cleaning a whole room, it's wise to eliminate those clean products and even seal other spaces that are undamaged. Bear in mind the shoes you're wearing so you don't track soot stains into other rooms.<p>
