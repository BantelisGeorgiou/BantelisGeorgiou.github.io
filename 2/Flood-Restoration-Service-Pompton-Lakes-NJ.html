<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always hassle-free. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little skill, but it's well worth discovering. Once the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the specialist will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation procedure is thought about to complete.<p>
<p>If you're working with a smaller sized hole (as much as 6"), use a thin layer of joint substance around the hole. Place your spot into the hole. Utilizing a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the substance. Feather the edges of the compound and enable it to dry. Sand gently with a fine-grit sandpaper and use a second layer of joint substance to finish the repair.
