<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through airborne pathogens. What you might not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been proven inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact facilitates mold development.

<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers choose paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I prefer paper tape, too.
