<p>When water freezes, it broadens, and that can be an issue for your home. Frozen water can cause pipelines to burst, causing unpleasant and expensive repair. Luckily, there are actions you can take to avoid a water catastrophe. As the temperature level drops, keep a consistent drip of water running to help avoid freezing. Pay unique attention to pipelines in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other places that might not be getting the exact same amount of heat as other locations in your home. Wrapping them in a layer of insulation can go a long way in preventing a burst.</p>
