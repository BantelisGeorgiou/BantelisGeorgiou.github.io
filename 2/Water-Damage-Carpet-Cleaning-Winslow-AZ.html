<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to evaluate which drying devices or techniques will be the most effective. It is imperative to determine if conditions are attainable within the drying chamber based upon the outside temperature level and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating system. These conditions can help in determining what equipment to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, latent and sensible energy, can be calculated by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly forecasts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to numerous structure products and how they react to each one and offer the best evaporation results. The higher the number, the quicker materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more practical if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>

We prevent more damage using our own modern water extraction, drying and dehumidification equipment for our water damage restoration services.
