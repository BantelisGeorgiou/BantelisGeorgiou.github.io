<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Sometimes it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls might show noticeable signs of moisture, dripping water, or indications of stopping working structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might fall apart or sag under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous gypsum material. Other times, you might notice little signs like coffee-colored stains that might expand over time.</p>
<p>The most crucial aspect of fixing drywall water damage is to prevent extra damage from mold or mildew. Mold and mildew happen most frequently when wet drywall sits with insufficient ventilation.
