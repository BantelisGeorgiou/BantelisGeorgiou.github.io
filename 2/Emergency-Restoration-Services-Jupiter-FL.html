The dew point is the temperature level the air requires to be cooled to, at continuous pressure, in order to accomplish an RH if 100%. At this point the air can not hold more water in gas form. If the air were to be cooled much more, water vapor would have to come out of the atmosphere in a liquid form. The higher the humidity rises, the greater the amount of wetness in the air.</p>
