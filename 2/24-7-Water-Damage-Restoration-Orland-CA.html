Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other parts. The liquid's salts and minerals right away start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly rusting. If there is a power source readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely wind up with a really expensive paperweight.</p>
