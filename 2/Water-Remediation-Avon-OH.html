<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has actually soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) get rid of the moisture in the air with powerful dehumidifiers. There might be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes checking ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the wet air.
