These filters are tested and certified to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they eliminate a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is launched through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor removed. This process goes on for days. As you can think of, over the course of several days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
