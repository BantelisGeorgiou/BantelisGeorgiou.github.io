When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot done in one day!  Someone has come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to finish the job correctly.
