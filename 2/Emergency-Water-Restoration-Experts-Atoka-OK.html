<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of home damage that a household or business can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other components. The liquid's salts and minerals immediately start to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Typically, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that quit working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electrical current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a very pricey paperweight if this deterioration process is not stopped.</p>
