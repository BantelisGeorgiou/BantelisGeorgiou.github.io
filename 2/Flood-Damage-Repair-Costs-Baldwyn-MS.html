<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. In some cases it will be apparent that you have water dripping either behind your walls or onto the ceiling from above. The ceiling or walls may reveal visible indications of wetness, leaking water, or signs of stopping working structural integrity. Ceiling drywall panels might crumble or droop under the weight of water that saturates the naturally porous gypsum product. Other times, you might observe little indications like coffee-colored spots that might expand over time.</p>
<p>The most crucial aspect of correcting drywall water damage is to prevent additional damage from mold or mildew. When damp drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew happen most regularly. Despite the location or extent of the damage, we recommend utilizing dehumidifiers, commercial fans, or similar machines that can move a large volume of air for optimum ventilation. Basic household fans are not efficient in moving a sufficient quantity of air needed to dry a room effectively.</p>

<p>After you discover how to remove mold, concentrate on preventing it in the future. Controlling moisture is the key to stopping most mold. The worst invasions normally happen in wet crawl areas, attics, walls where water dripped in from the outside, and in basements with bad structure drainage. Stopping leaks, ensuring excellent ventilation in attics, keeping crawl spaces dry and routing water away from the structure are the best defenses versus mold.</p>
