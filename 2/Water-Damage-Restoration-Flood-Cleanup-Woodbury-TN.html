Led by Dr. Mark Hernandez, an internationally acknowledged expert on the biological aspects of air contamination, this group was appointed to validate and test the new technology.

These filters are tested and accredited to 99.99% HEPA performance, which indicates that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size.
