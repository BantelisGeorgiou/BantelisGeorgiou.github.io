<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or issues with excess moisture is at risk of mold growth. Use a respirator or a facemask rated for black mold spore protection, and cover hands, legs and arms to avoid contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of visible mold. If the musty area is dry, gently spray with water, as this will reduce the incidence of airborne mold spores during cleaning. Next, use commercial black mold removal items, which can be found in the majority of hardware or home repair shops, to decontaminate the moldy areas, in addition to any adjacent areas. Make sure it will not discolor the material or surface if you utilize bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other materials used in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, remove the bag through a close-by exit instead of the primary house, to prevent distributing mold spores.</p>
