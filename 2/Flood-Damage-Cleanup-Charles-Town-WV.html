They also finished the entire dry which took several days and a great deal of hard work. Always shown up on time and did what they guaranteed and kept me notified of each step. It was a pleasure to handle the whole team. I would not think twice to suggest them for any work of this nature consisting of mold repair and restoration work.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out how much water costs I was paying given that the leakage started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and after that even assisted me shut down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really respectful person.</p>
<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Charles Town</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold professionals usually recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry section. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the service on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a carpet or brush till the mold vanishes. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to wash it off. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on permeable surfaces like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly. This could worsen the issue since as you know - mold likes wet environments.<p>
