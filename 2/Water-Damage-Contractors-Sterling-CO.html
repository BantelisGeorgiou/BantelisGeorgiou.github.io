<p>Because common structure products can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>

<p>Understanding how to determine exactly what is damp throughout a water loss is a crucial part of the job. Germs and molds can grow if locations of wetness are ignored.

Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air.
