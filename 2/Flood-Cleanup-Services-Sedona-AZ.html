<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly harmful. Whether the musty items can be cleaned or whether they require to be removed and replaced. Fabrics might be cleaned, for example, but anything the mold and moisture might have completely blemished or damaged, such as drywall 3, insulation, or carpets might require to be removed. Expenses start at $2,000 for cleaning materials, but can reach $10,000 for getting rid of and changing drywall 3 and carpets.</p>
<p>According to Lstiburek, the response was easy: It was a best storm"-- a combination that attorneys now declare originated from pressure to construct much faster, an industrywide switch to lower-cost structure materials, and little government and contractor oversight.
