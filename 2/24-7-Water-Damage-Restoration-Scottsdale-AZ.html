<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. As pointed out, rapid air motion across damp surfaces of assemblies or materials is a critical component of successfully and effectively drying the surface of those materials and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the products or assemblies. Fast air motion throughout the surface area of material ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of getting rid of surface moisture gives way to reducing moisture content in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying products need various requirements for altering conditions.</p>
