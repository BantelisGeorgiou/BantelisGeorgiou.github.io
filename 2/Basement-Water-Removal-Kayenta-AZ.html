With solid hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area.

<p>Cleanup: Throughout the cleaning and restoration stage of the project, your trained cleanup group will use the appropriate combination of cleaning representatives, air cleaning gadgets, and deodorizers.

Walls and ceilings that need to be cleaned are very first cleaned up with a dry chem-sponge, then with a degreaser and ventilating representative. These several steps are required to make sure ceilings and walls are clean and that recurring smell has been removed.</p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility told me if it's going at the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he learnt just how much water bill I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leakage for me and after that even helped me closed down my primary water valve. Easy-going and really polite person.</p>
