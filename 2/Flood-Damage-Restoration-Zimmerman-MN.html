<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this suggests that the smoke will spread, damaging a much wider location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be.
