<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is primarily water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
