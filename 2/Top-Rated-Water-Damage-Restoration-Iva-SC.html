<p>Considering that it's impossible to get rid of mold in the house completely, it's important to keep your air clear by frequently changing air filters. Consider utilizing High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which are developed to trap 99.97% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger (mold is normally 3 - 12 microns) in order to keep mold from flowing. You may also think about an air cleanser that will eliminate mold spores. If you live in a particularly wet environment, find one with an antimicrobial filter to ensure that the filter itself remains devoid of mold.</p>
<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the moist desiccant to the reactivation air stream to heat it up. When wet incoming air streams over a wheel filled with a silica gel desiccant, desiccant dehumidifiers work. This process takes in wetness without ice accumulation and is not limited by low temperatures. Desiccants can easily operate listed below freezing temperatures.</p>
