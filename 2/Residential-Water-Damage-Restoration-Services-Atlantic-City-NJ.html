<p>Water invasion into structures can be exceptionally destructive. Jake and his people were amazing in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (frequently two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and also were really practical in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd suggest them without doubt.</p>
