<p>Corrosion is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the progressive and slow wear and tear of materials (typically metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion takes place when you integrate electrical power, water, oxygen and metal, producing iron oxide (or what is more frequently called rust). There is no reliable schedule for this process to take place; a MacBook's internal components typically start wearing away right away after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without revealing any apparent indication of an issue. How quick the corrosion process takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and for how long the gadget remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or utilize the MacBook at all till you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of corrosion caused by a water spill.</p>
