Did you know that smoke is really made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be.
