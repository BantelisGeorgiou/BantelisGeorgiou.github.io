<p>Health issues: White mold can cause issues such as eye irritation, headaches, lightheadedness, and respiratory issues. When a mold infestation becomes bigger than three square feet or is tough to clean, you should call a professional for mold remediation.

<p>Tape over the seams with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth discovering.
