Basic home fans are not capable of moving an appropriate quantity of air required to dry a space effectively.</p>

Set an old box fan or an inexpensive brand-new one in a window to ventilate the space while working.

<p>9. Get rid of the furnishings and floor covering. Clean your furniture and let dry completely. Floor covering is tough to save, particularly when flooded with polluted water like river water or sewage system water. You might be able to save your floor covering if you were flooded with clean water and it's bone dry within 24 hr. If not, rip it up. To prevent mold in the restroom, make certain to open windows if you have them to improve ventilation and run the fan when showering, cleaning or shaving.

Scrub mold from surfaces as quickly as it appears, then make certain to dry the area to prevent it from spreading.<p>
