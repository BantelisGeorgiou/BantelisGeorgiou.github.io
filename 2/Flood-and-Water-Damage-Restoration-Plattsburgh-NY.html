Fix any leaks or underlying problems immediately to assist prevent mold growth or its return. Mold exists naturally in the air inside and beyond your home. Therefore, it is not possible to completely get rid of" all of the mold from within a building, as tiny spores will still exist even after the problem has actually been dealt with.<p>
<p>In advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: major leakage or glowing floor heating leakage), fixing the subfloor might even be essential. For finest results, refinish the whole space, as trying to repair a little area will show up for many years, providing an obvious indication that the floor has actually had some kind of damage.
