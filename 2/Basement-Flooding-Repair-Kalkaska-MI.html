<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying devices or techniques will be the most efficient. It is essential to determine if conditions are possible within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature and specific humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, sensible and latent energy, can be determined by utilize of the Enthalpy Evaporation Examination Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula precisely forecasts the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to several building products and how they react to each one and supply the very best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the faster products will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
