<p>Inspect the drywall to see how much damage has been done. Heavily water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or crumble to the touch. Eliminate all compromised drywall by hand or utilize the claw end of a hammer or a wrecking bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels just show water spots but aren't structurally jeopardized, they may be repairable by cutting out the damaged portion. When cutting out around the damaged location, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangle-shaped shape. You can then make a spot with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
