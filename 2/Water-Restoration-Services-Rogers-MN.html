<p>Flooding of a personal sewer system can be a dangerous circumstance for homeowners, according to Pipes 2.0's veteran plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It may result in a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and absence of sanitation up until the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a personal sewer system can not function correctly (typical plumbing problems in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater depend on aerobic (with oxygen) areas to reduce the quantities of chemicals and living organisms (infections, bacteria and protozoa). When the soil is filled or flooded, those hazardous products can go into the groundwater and your drinking water supply.</p>
<p>During sewage backups or other black water damages, big amounts of bacteria can enter the interior environment and posture possibly serious health threats to the residents.
