<p>Since common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
