<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us get through flooding from Typhoon Florence.

They discussed everything they were doing along the method and also were extremely practical in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
