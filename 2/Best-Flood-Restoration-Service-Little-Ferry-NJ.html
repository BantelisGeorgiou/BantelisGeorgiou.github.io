<p>Flooding of a private sewage system can be a hazardous situation for house owners, according to Plumbing 2.0's veteran plumbing experts in Mesa, Arizona It might lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, infected drinking water and lack of sanitation up until the system is repaired. When flooding or saturated soil conditions continue, a private sewer system can not function properly (typical pipes issues in old houses ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater rely on aerobic (with oxygen) regions to reduce the quantities of chemicals and living organisms (infections, bacteria and protozoa). When the soil is filled or flooded, those dangerous products can go into the groundwater and your drinking supply of water.</p>
