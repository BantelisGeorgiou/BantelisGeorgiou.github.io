<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the products it's used on as it is an extreme, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach also releases extreme fumes and it even produces hazardous gas when combined with ammonia. There are much safer options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce hazardous fumes or leave behind hazardous residue. For these reasons attempt to avoid utilizing bleach and if you should utilize it, just use it on non-porous surface areas.</p>

<p>Jake (and his team) are incredible to deal with. They were quick to react initially and provided a affordable and reasonable quote. They were able to fit us into their schedule immediately and get the work done really quickly. Our mold concern wound up being smaller than first thought so the final invoice reflected the real work required and was less than first priced quote. Jake was very responsive to calls and emails responding to concerns throughout the procedure. All in all, I had a very good experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a costs for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he found out how much water costs I was paying since the leakage started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the area & found of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and extremely courteous individual.</p>
