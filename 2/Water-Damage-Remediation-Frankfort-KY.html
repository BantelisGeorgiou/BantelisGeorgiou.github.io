<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unidentified and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a costs for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he learnt just how much water costs I was paying given that the leakage began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the location of the leak for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Really polite and easy-going individual.</p>
