Any notable sagging in parts of the walls or ceiling is an indication that you need water damage repair services. Drywall 1 sags when filled with water. Seeing noticeable mold on the walls is another indication, however not everyone notices mold within their houses. Before mold is located, you may smell a distinct musty scent or experience allergy symptoms due to mold direct exposure. These smells are specifically pungent in locations like the basement. The foul smell is similar to the fragrance of damp, mildewy laundry. Regrettably, it's not uncommon for house owners to mistake mold growth for dirt.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The biggest action in the procedure is restoration. Restoration includes replacing materials like drywall and insulation. Sometimes this process is as easy as installing a few panels of drywall, while serious cases could need replacing whole walls. Exposure to poisonous compounds like lead and asbestos is possible throughout restoration. Older houses are likely to contain these compounds.</p>
