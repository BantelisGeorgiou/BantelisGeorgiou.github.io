<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't think they got so much performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel great in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job correctly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>Mold - the appearance, the odor, even the idea of it makes you recoil. You most likely have visions of long-forgotten takeout food crammed in the back of your fridge, or an old shabby bath tub that hasn't been used in years. But aside from what may be growing in your fridge, home mold is really really typical, and can represent a significant health threat if left unchecked. After removing all infected and damp materials, contact someone who can check your home and start the restoration process.<p>
<p>Utilize a fabric or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, since it could accidentally push liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. If the phone was completely submerged, you may attempt vacuuming around the phone's fractures and openings to draw more water out. As soon as the mold is gone, the chore isn't over yet. Correct cleanup after mold removal is essential to prevent recontamination. You must seal and right away get rid of products that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the boots or shoes you used while cleaning, clean your clothing in hot water, and shower to wash away spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
