<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly devastating. Jake and his men were incredible in helping us get through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to your house and started drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep track of and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described whatever they were doing along the method and also were very handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings need to be included in the drying record to include devices, air, and hvac systems. Wetness material levels for damp structural materials must be tape-recorded in a wetness material spreadsheet to show the progress of drying These recorded wetness content readings will reveal that the building is back to an appropriate variety of pre-loss condition. It is important to know that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hr the psychrometric conditions will show if adequate dehumidification is being utilized or if adjustments are required.</p>
