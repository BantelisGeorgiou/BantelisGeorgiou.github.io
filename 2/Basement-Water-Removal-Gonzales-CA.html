<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Try to find visible mold growth (it might look cottony, creamy, rough, or leathery and have various colors like white, gray, brown, black, yellow, or green). Mold typically looks like a staining or fuzzy development on furniture or building materials (walls, ceilings, or anything made from wood or paper).

<p>The most crucial aspect of correcting drywall water damage is to avoid additional damage from mold or mildew. When moist drywall sits with inadequate ventilation, mold and mildew occur most often.

Basic family fans are not capable of moving an appropriate amount of air needed to dry a room adequately.</p>
