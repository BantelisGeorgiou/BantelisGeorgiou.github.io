<p>Due to the fact that common structure materials are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
