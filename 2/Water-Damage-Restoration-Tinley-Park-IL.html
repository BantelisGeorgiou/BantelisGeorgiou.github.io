<p>If smoke and fire damage has impacted your possessions, we will deal with you and your insurance company to identify what can be brought back, and what will be an insurance coverage replacement claim. For products that can be brought back, we use ultrasonic cleaning to restore your damaged personal belongings.

Essentially, it makes the location strong again and secures the surface area from future water damage. After you have actually applied the Peel-Stop, allow for an hour of drying time.<p>
