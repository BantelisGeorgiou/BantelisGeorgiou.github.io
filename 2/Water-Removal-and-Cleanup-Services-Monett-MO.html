<p>Water intrusion into structures can be extremely damaging. Jake and his people were fantastic in helping us make it through flooding from Hurricane Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying our drenched crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to monitor and change the dehumidifiers and fans to maximize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the method and also were very valuable in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without hesitation.</p>
