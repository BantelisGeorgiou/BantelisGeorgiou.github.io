<h3>Fire Damage Restoration in Bowling Green</h3>
<p>It is easy for a property owner to think the damage to their home or service is limited to the aesthetically verified damage. At FP Residential Or Commercial Property Restoration, we understand that this is not the case. Surrounding areas, contents, ventilation systems, and surfaces are all affected by smoke, water from the extinguishment of the fire, and the recurring odor that, if not treated correctly, will never ever leave your residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Likewise, considering that bleach is mostly water, on permeable surface areas, such as wood or drywall, the water in the bleach is quickly absorbed by the material. So, while you might have rubbed out or discolored the surface area mold to the point that you can't see it, you've really offered plenty of water to regrow and potentially spread the mold underneath the surface. If there is a lot of mold growth, consult the U.S. Epa's guidance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings ". Printable variations of these and other assistance documents are available on the EPA's Publications on Mold website If the moldy material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be necessary.<p>
