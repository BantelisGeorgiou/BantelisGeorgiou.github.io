Warm air in between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal, particularly for the very first 36 to 2 days of drying and is the optimum temperature for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit aids in the evaporation process. Overly hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit impedes the dehumidifiers' efficiency.<p>
<p>After scrubbing the surfaces, enable the bleach option to continue to permeate the surfaces and dry. Getting a location dry needs eliminating the moisture not only from the affected products but likewise from the air.
