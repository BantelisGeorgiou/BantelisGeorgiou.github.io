Did you understand that smoke is in fact made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people think that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
