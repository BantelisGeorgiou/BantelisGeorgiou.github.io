Lots of people think that since smoke increases into the air, diffusion happens, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this means that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
