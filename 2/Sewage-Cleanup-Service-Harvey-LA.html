With time, roofs might establish dark streaks. It may be dirt that can be simply power-washed off, or it might be mold. You should not have anything growing, or even creating an inviting environment, for critters, bugs, or birds.

Otherwise, a mold problem restricted to available, hard surface areas-- such as bathroom walls, basement floorings, or wood trim-- can be tackled with the best equipment and some persistence.
