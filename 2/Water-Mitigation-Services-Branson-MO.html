Air filtering systems are generally used in combination with the sealing of the location to get rid of as many airborne spores as possible and to avoid spread. Sealing the location includes the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative atmospheric pressure, which prevents the flow of air between the contaminated space and the areas around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be switched off to prevent the mold from spreading also.</p>
