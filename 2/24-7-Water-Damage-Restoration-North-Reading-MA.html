<h3>Fire Damage Repair in North Reading</h3>
<p>A Do It Yourself mold remediation product that mold specialists typically recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the cleaning agent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Apply the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a rug or brush up until the mold disappears. There's no need to rinse it off due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from returning. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly. This could aggravate the problem since as you understand - mold likes wet environments.<p>
