<p>The Epa (EPA) advises disposing of products that have not been completely cleaned and dried within 48 hours of water damage. Repair any leakages or underlying problems immediately to help avoid mold growth or its return. Mold exists naturally in the air inside and outside of your home.

<p>Just remember that this is likely to invalidate any service warranty protection you have actually got, and there's a threat that your Do It Yourself work will trigger damage rather than repair it.
