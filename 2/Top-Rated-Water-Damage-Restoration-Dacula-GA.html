<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a hazardous, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many individuals believe that because smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this suggests that the smoke will spread out, damaging a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>

<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our cooking area after we discovered our faucet was dripping. They were quick to respond and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They set up a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and hauled away everything else.  We were very delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next business day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really expert and hardworking.  I could not think they got so much done in one day!  Someone has actually come out each day to sign in and I feel confident in their understanding and capabilities to finish the job properly. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
