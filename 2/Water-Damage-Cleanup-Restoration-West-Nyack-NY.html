<p>In the course of a remediation, we sometimes suggest discarding specific kinds of items and surfaces. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical items in requirement of disposal. That's all part of the cleanup procedure, which also includes vacuuming and sweeping up any dirt or minor particles overlooked in the remediation procedure. A special HEPA vacuum guarantees that even tiny particles get gathered to decrease the chances of the mold moving elsewhere. This help in our efforts at containment of the mold.
