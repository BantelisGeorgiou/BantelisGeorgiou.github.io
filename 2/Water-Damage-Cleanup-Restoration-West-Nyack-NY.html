<p>In the course of a remediation, we sometimes suggest discarding specific kinds of items and surfaces. Carpets, cabinets and drywall are all typical items in requirement of disposal.

A special HEPA vacuum guarantees that even tiny particles get gathered to decrease the chances of the mold moving elsewhere. This help in our efforts at containment of the mold.
