<p>Whip up a mold-fighting service when you have actually spotted the offending development. While plenty of agents can combat mold (Borax, vinegar, bleach, and ammonia, among others), tea tree oil and grapefruit seed extract are typically considered the most efficient products to sanitize and ventilate the problem area. Additionally, they're entirely non-toxic. You can buy tea tree oil online and in health stores; simply make sure that its from melaleuca alternifolia (an Australian tree) and that its active components include 30 percent terpinen 4-ol and no greater than 10 to 15 percent cineole. Grapefruit seed extract may be a little less efficient but simpler to find, likewise readily available from these sorts of sellers.<p>
